	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The Nissan Leopard, a sporty luxury car series by Nissan, debuted in 1980 and ceased production in 1999. Initially based on models like the Nissan Skyline and Laurel, it later shifted to platforms like the Cedric and Gloria, all rear-wheel drive. The Leopard was offered as a sedan at Nissan Bluebird Store and as a coupe at Nissan Motor Store. Its discontinuation was due to Nissan's Revival Plan, succeeded by the Nissan Fuga.</h1>
